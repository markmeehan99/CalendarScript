# CalendarScript

This is a small project I developed so that I could easily check on my Google Calendar which events are soon to come. By running this script, and granting access to your Google Account, you can:
- Check which events are next in line
- Add events by type, just by selecting the date and time. Colors will be generated accordingly, taking into account the event type
- Delete event

This project was built by accessing [Google Calendar's API](https://developers.google.com/calendar)
